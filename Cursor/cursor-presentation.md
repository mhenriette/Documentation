### Chat
Interaction with an AI that understands your codebase. Asking questions about the current file and cursor. you can access the chat by clicking on the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the editor or Cmd+L.

## Advanced Features

### @ Symbols
Showing code to the AI. Generating code with dependencies or asking about a file.

### Codebase-wide Answers
This feature allows you to ask questions about your codebase and get relevant answers. This feature saves time by eliminating manual searches for where to start changes or which method to call. To use it, load your codebase in Cursor, open the chat (via the chat icon or Cmd+L), and ask your question. The AI will analyze your codebase and provide an answer. The more specific your question, the more accurate the answer will be. For example, instead of asking "Where should I add code?", ask "Where should I add a new function to handle user authentication?".


### Docs
Docs in Cursor are designed to enhance the AI's understanding of third-party libraries. This feature allows you to add custom documentation to your codebase, which the AI can then use to provide more accurate and context-aware suggestions. 

To use Docs, you first need to access the feature from the Cursor interface. Once there, you can add your custom documentation by either writing it directly into the provided field or uploading a file. The AI will then analyze this documentation and use it to improve its understanding of your codebase, particularly in relation to any third-party libraries you're using.

This feature is particularly useful when working with less common libraries or when your codebase includes custom functions or methods that the AI might not immediately understand. By providing additional context through Docs, you can ensure that the AI's suggestions are as accurate and helpful as possible.

### Auto Debug
Auto Debugging in Cursor's terminal is a powerful feature that leverages AI to identify and fix errors in your code. The AI scans your code, identifies potential issues, and suggests solutions to rectify them. This process is automated, saving you valuable time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual debugging. The AI's ability to understand your codebase allows it to provide relevant and accurate solutions, making the debugging process more efficient and intuitive.

### Fix Lints
The Fix Lints feature in Cursor is a powerful tool that leverages AI to quickly identify and rectify lint errors in your code. This feature is designed to save you time and effort by automating the process of lint error correction.

To use the Fix Lints feature, you first need to run your code in Cursor. The AI will automatically scan your code for lint errors. Once the scan is complete, the AI will highlight any lint errors it has identified and provide suggestions for how to fix them. You can then choose to accept these suggestions, or you can manually edit the code yourself.

The Fix Lints feature is particularly useful when working with large codebases, as it can quickly identify and correct lint errors that might otherwise be missed. By leveraging AI to automate this process, you can ensure that your code is clean, efficient, and free of lint errors.

### Terminal Command K
Using Terminal Command K, you can write terminal commands in plain English. This feature allows you to interact with the terminal in a more intuitive and user-friendly way. For instance, instead of remembering and typing complex commands, you can simply tell Cursor what you want to do in natural language. For example, if you want to create a new directory, you can type "Create a new directory named 'Test'". Cursor will understand your instruction and execute the appropriate terminal command. This feature is particularly useful for beginners who are not familiar with terminal commands, as well as for experienced developers who want to streamline their workflow.

### Notes
Notes in Cursor are used for comprehending unfamiliar variables and types in your code. They provide a quick summary of a symbol, enhancing your understanding and efficiency while coding. 

For example, if you come across a variable `userAuth` in your code and you're unsure about its purpose, you can simply hover over it and a note will appear providing a brief summary of its function. Similarly, if you're working with a custom type `OrderStatus` and need a quick refresher on its structure, you can use notes to get a concise overview without having to navigate away from your current location in the code.

To use notes, simply hover over the variable or type in question. A note will automatically appear providing a summary. If you want to add your own notes, right-click on the variable or type, select 'Add Note', and type in your explanation. This can be particularly useful for providing additional context or explaining complex code structures.

### Vision
The Vision feature in Cursor utilizes images to stimulate the AI's responses. This is particularly useful in the context of web user interfaces. By feeding the AI with images, it can understand the visual elements of your project and provide more accurate and context-aware suggestions. For instance, if you're working on a web design project, you can use this feature to show the AI an image of your design mockup. The AI will analyze the image and provide code suggestions that align with the visual elements in the image. This feature is used to bridge the gap between visual design and code, making it easier for developers to translate their design ideas into functional code.

### Apply From Chat
In Cursor, you can utilize the feature of applying code suggestions from the chat directly into your editor. This is how the AI assists in suggesting a rewrite for your codebase.

### Rules for AI
The Rules for AI in Cursor are designed to guide the AI's code generation process. They allow you to specify style guidelines that the AI should follow when writing code. This feature is there to ensure that the AI's output aligns with your coding standards and preferences, providing you with more control over the AI's code style.

## Security and Privacy
Cursor provides a one-click migration feature from VSCode, ensuring a seamless transition. Additionally, it offers a Privacy mode for secure coding, ensuring your code remains private and secure.
